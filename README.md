# Chapter I: Introduction

## 1.1 Background of the Study
Online Public Access Catalogs (OPAC), or simply Library Catalogs, are online collections of library materials available to the public. A library catalog is a register of bibliographic items in a library such as books, computer files, graphics, and more that are considered as library material and are useful to the users.

One example of an existing online library catalog is Herdin (herdin.ph). Herdin is a health research information management system and collaboration platform for Higher Education and Research and Development Institutions to collect, organize, and disseminate research information.

The main objective of the project is to provide an OPAC/Online Repository that will help not only the organization but also researchers in the field of Law to find necessary materials for their studies and research.

## 1.2 Scope and Delimitation
This project will focus on developing a research information management system, or an online repository, specifically for the field of Law in the Philippines. The system will be accessible to students, researchers, and the general public. The following processes will be implemented in the system:
- Search Engine
- User and Admin Accounts
- Contacting the Admins using HTML forms

The system will have the following functionalities:
- Login/Logout for users and admins
- About page
- Help/Contact Us page
- A dedicated web page for admin data entry
- Search Engine with filter and sorting options for results
- Advanced search filters for easier paper retrieval
- Ability for users to request permission for restricted research papers

The system will only serve as an online repository for law journals from the Philippines. Due to time constraints, the system will be designed for a resolution of 1400 x 900, and the production team will not host the system on a server.
